## Purpose
These customizations enhance the WooCommerce connector's functionality by:
- Improving queue management and error handling
- Enhancing product and inventory synchronization
- Adding support for custom product types and brands
- Providing better control over synchronization processes
- Ensuring data consistency across platforms

## Related Modules
- `common_connector_library` - Base connector library (also customized)
- `shopify_ept` - Shopify connector (also customized)

## Business Benefits
- **Operational Efficiency**: Better queue management and automatic synchronization reduce manual work
- **Data Accuracy**: Enhanced stock and product synchronization ensures consistent information
- **Flexibility**: Support for custom product types and selective sync provides operational flexibility
- **Error Prevention**: Improved error handling and rollback mechanisms prevent data inconsistencies
- **Geographic Support**: Area integration and Arabic brand handling support regional business needs

## Required enhancements

### 1. Line-level discounts on imported orders
- Currently, when importing an order with a discount applied to it, the discount comes as a separate line in Odoo.
- This causes reporting issues:
  - Product-grouped reports show gross amounts (without applied per-line discounts)
  - Margin-by-product reports are inaccurate because the discount is calculated separately from the product line

#### Suggested Fixes (Either one)
- Instead of using the discount product, to use the product that the discount is applied for
- Modify the unit price for the product so it would be discounted in the same line
