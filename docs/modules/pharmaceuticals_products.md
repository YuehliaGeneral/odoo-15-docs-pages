# Pharmaceuticals Products - Customizations

**Module**: `pharmaceuticals_products`  
**Type**: Custom (1)  
**Status**: âœ… In active use  

## Overview
The Pharmaceuticals Products module automatically creates journal entries for consignment products based on percentages set for each vendor. The module triggers when invoices/credit notes are validated or cancelled and contain consignment products, creating appropriate journal entries automatically.

**Note**: To eliminate confusion, the technical name "pharmaceuticals" or "deals" refers to "Consignment Product"

## Workflow Documentation

### Step 4: Journal Creation
**Trigger**: When an invoice/credit note is validated or cancelled and contains deals products, journal entries are automatically created.

**Multiple Products**: If the invoice or credit note contains multiple deals products, multiple journals will be created accordingly.
