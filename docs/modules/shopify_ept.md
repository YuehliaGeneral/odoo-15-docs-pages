## Required enhancements

### 1. Line-level discounts on imported orders
- Currently, when importing an order with a discount applied to it, the discount comes as a separate line in Odoo.
- This causes reporting issues:
  - Product-grouped reports show gross amounts (without applied per-line discounts)
  - Margin-by-product reports are inaccurate because the discount is calculated separately from the product line

#### Suggested Fixes (Either one)
- Instead of using the discount product, to use the product that the discount is applied for
- Modify the unit price for the product so it would be discounted in the same line
